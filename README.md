This is a filter design made in matlab for the "Electronica IV" Subject in the Bioengineering Career in the "Universidad de Entre Rios" in Argentina.

We use the Matlab software to design the filters, both the analog and digital versions, and the Multisim tool to simulate an electronic circuit (that is also then implemented physically in a protoboard).

The filters are designed to meet the requirements specified in the .pdf file. Said file documents in detail the entire process and the conclusions, and it's in Spanish.

How to run this program
-----------------------

1. Fit all the files in the same project folder.
2. Compile TP3digital.m and TP3analogico.m to see the results of the Digital and Analog filters, respectively. The code is heavily commented in Spanish so it should be easy to understand. If you know Spanish, that is :P
